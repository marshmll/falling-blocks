# Falling Blocks
![Falling Blocks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marshmll/falling-blocks/main/Screenshots/falling%20blocks.png)

This is a simple two dimensional game made in C++ using **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

I made this game for developing C++ experiente and knowledge :)

Click on the falling blocks as fast and precise you can to get points. When the block hit the screen bottom bound, you will lose one of your 20 lifes. Good luck!

## Running the game
 1. Make sure you have **G++ installed**;
 2. Make sure you have **SFML C++ libraries installed**;
 3. Make sure you have **Make** installed;
 4. Inside the ```/Release``` folder, run ```make all```;
 5. Open the compiled executable;
 6. Enjoy!
